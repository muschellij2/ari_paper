\abstract{%
We present the \texttt{ari} package for automatically generating
technology-focused educational videos. The goal of the package is to be
able to create reproducible videos, with the ability to change and
update video content seamlessly. We present several examples of
generating videos including using R Markdown slide decks, PowerPoint
slides, or simple images as source material. We also discuss how
\texttt{ari} can help instructors reach new audiences through
programmatically translating materials into other languages.

\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Videos are a crucial way people learn and they are pervasive in online
education platforms (TODO: Cite). Producing educational videos with a
lecturer speaking over slides takes time, energy, and usually video
editing skills. Maintaining the accuracy and relevancy of lecture videos
focused on technical subjects like computing programming or data science
can often require remaking an entire video, requiring extensive editing
and splicing of new segments. We present \CRANpkg{ari}, the
\textbf{A}utomated \textbf{R} \textbf{I}nstructor as a tool to address
these issues by creating reproducible presentations and videos that can
be automatically generated from plain text files or similar artifacts.
By using \pkg{ari}, we provide a tool for users to rapidly create and
update video content.

In its simplest form a lecture video is comprised of visual content
(e.g.~slides and figures) and a spoken explanation of the visual
content. Instead of a human lecturer the \pkg{ari} package uses a
text-to-speech system to synthesize spoken audio for a lecture. Modern
text-to-speech systems which take advantage of recent advancements in
artificial intelligence research are available from
\href{https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/}{Google},
\href{https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/text-to-speech/}{Microsoft},
and \href{https://aws.amazon.com/polly/}{Amazon}. Many of these
synthesizers make use of deep learning methods, such as WaveNet (Van Den
Oord et al. 2016) and have interfaces in R (Edmondson 2019; Muschelli
2019a; Leeper 2017). Currently in \pkg{ari}, synthesis of the the audio
can be rendered using any of these services through the
\CRANpkg{text2speech} (Muschelli 2019b) package. The default is
\href{https://aws.amazon.com/polly/}{Amazon Polly}, which has text to
speech voice generation in over 21 languages, including a total of 29
dialects, implemented in the \CRANpkg{aws.polly} package (Leeper 2017).
In addition to multiple languages, the speech generation services
provide voices with several pitches representing different genders
within the same language. We present the \pkg{ari} package with
reproducible use case examples and the video outputs with different
voices in multiple languages.

The \pkg{ari} package relies on the \CRANpkg{tuneR} package for
splitting and combining audio files appropriately so that lecture
narration is synced with each slide (Ligges et al. 2018). Once the audio
is generated, it is synced with images to make a lecture video. Multiple
open source tools for video editing and splicing exist. \pkg{ari} takes
advantage of the \texttt{ffmpeg} (\url{http://www.ffmpeg.org/})
software, a command-line interface to the \texttt{libav} library. These
powerful tools have been thoroughly tested with a development history
spanning almost 20 years. \pkg{ari} uses \texttt{ffmpeg} to piece
together images and audio into a lecture video. \pkg{ari} has been built
with presets for \texttt{ffmpeg} which allow output videos to be
compatible with multiple platforms, including the YouTube and Coursera
players. These presets include specifying the bitrate, audio and video
codecs, and the output video format. The numerous additional video
specifications for customization can be applied to command-line
arguments \texttt{ffmpeg} through \pkg{ari}.

We have developed a workflow with \pkg{ari} as the centerpiece for
automatically generating educational videos. The narration script for
lecture videos is stored in a plain text format, so that it can be
synthesized into audio files via text-to-speech services. By storing
lecture narration in plain text it can be updated, tracked, and
collaboratively or automatically updated with version control software
like Git and GitHub. If the figures in the lecture slides are created in
a reproducible framework, such as generated using R code, the entire
video can be reproducibly created and automatically updated. Thus,
\pkg{ari} is the Automated R Instructor. We will provide examples of
creating videos based on the following sets of source files: a slide
deck built with R Markdown, a set of images and a script, or a Google
Slide deck or PowerPoint presentation.

\hypertarget{making-videos-with-ari-ari_stitch}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Making videos with \texttt{ari}:
\texttt{ari\_stitch}}{Making videos with ari: ari\_stitch}}\label{making-videos-with-ari-ari_stitch}}

The main workhorse of \pkg{ari} is the \texttt{ari\_stitch} function.
This function requires an ordered set of images and an ordered set of
\pkg{tuneR} audio objects that correspond to each image. The
\texttt{ari\_stitch} function sequentially ``stitches'' each image which
is shown in the video for the duration of its corresponding audio object
using \texttt{ffmpeg}. In order to use \pkg{ari}, one must have an
\texttt{ffmpeg} installation to combine the audio and images. In the
example below, 2 images (packaged with \pkg{ari}) are overlaid withe
white noise for demonstration. This example also allows users to check
if the output of \texttt{ffmpeg} works with a desired video player.

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
library(tuneR)
library(ari)
result = ari_stitch(
  ari_example(c("mab1.png", "mab2.png")),
  list(noise(), noise()),
  output = "noise.mp4")
isTRUE(result)
attributes(result)$outfile
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Soutput}
[1] TRUE
\end{Soutput}
\begin{Soutput}
[1] "noise.mp4"
\end{Soutput}
\end{Schunk}

The output is a logical indicator of success and the path of the output
file.\\
The video for this output can be seen at
\url{https://youtu.be/3kgaYf-EV90}.

\hypertarget{synthesizer-authentication}{%
\subsection{Synthesizer
authentication}\label{synthesizer-authentication}}

The above example uses \texttt{tuneR::noise()} to generate audio and to
show that any audio object can be used with \pkg{ari}. In most cases
however, \pkg{ari} is most useful when combined with synthesizing audio
using a text-to-speech system. Though one can generate the spoken audio
in many ways, such as fitting a custom deep learning model, we will
focus on using the aforementioned services (e.g.~Amazon Polly) as they
have straightforward public web APIs. One obstacle in using such
services is that users must go through steps to provide authentication,
whereas most of these APIs and the associated R packages do not allow
for interactive authentication such as OAuth.

The \pkg{text2speech} package provides a unified interface to these 3
text-to-speech services, and we will focus on Amazon Polly and its
authentication requirements. Polly is authenticated using the
\CRANpkg{aws.signature} package (Leeper 2019). The \pkg{aws.signature}
documentation provides options and steps to create the relevant
credentials; we have also provided an additional
\href{http://seankross.com/2017/05/02/Access-Amazon-Web-Services-in-R.html}{tutorial}.
Essentially, the user must sign up for the service and retrieve public
and private API keys and put them into their R profile or other areas
accessible to R. Running
\texttt{text2speech::tts\_auth(service\ =\ "amazon")} will indicate if
authentication was successful (if using a different service, change the
\texttt{service} argument). NB: The APIs are generally paid services,
but many have free tiers or limits, such as Amazon Polly's free tier for
the first year (\url{https://aws.amazon.com/polly/pricing/}).

\hypertarget{creating-speech-from-text-ari_spin}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Creating Speech from Text:
\texttt{ari\_spin}}{Creating Speech from Text: ari\_spin}}\label{creating-speech-from-text-ari_spin}}

After Polly has been authenticated, videos can be created using the
\texttt{ari\_spin} function with an ordered set of images and a
corresponding ordered set of text strings. This text is the ``script''
that is spoken over the images to create the output video. The number of
elements in the text needs to be equal to the number of images. Let us
take a part of Mercutio's speech from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet
(Shakespeare 2003) and overlay it on two images from the Wikipedia page
about Mercutio (\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercutio}):

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
speech =  c(
  "I will now perform part of Mercutio's speech from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.", 
  "O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
   She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
   In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
   On the fore-finger of an alderman,
   Drawn with a team of little atomies
   Athwart men's noses as they lies asleep;")
mercutio_file = "death_of_mercutio.png"
mercutio_file2 = "mercutio_actor.png"
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
shakespeare_result = ari_spin(
  c(mercutio_file, mercutio_file2),
  speech, output = "romeo.mp4", voice = "Joanna")
isTRUE(shakespeare_result)
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Soutput}
[1] TRUE
\end{Soutput}
\end{Schunk}

The speech output can be seen at \url{https://youtu.be/SFhvM9gI0kE}.\\
We chose the voice ``Joanna'' which is designated as a female sounding
US-English speaker for the script. Each voice is language-dependent; we
can see the available voices for English for Amazon Polly at
\url{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/SupportedLanguage.html}.

Though the voice generation is relatively clear, we chose a
Shakespearean example to demonstrate the influence and production value
of the variety of dialects available from these text-to-speech services.
Compare the video of ``Joanna'' to the same video featuring ``Brian''
who ``speaks'' with a British English dialect:

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
gb_result = ari_spin(
  c(mercutio_file, mercutio_file2),
  speech, output = "romeo_gb.mp4", voice = "Brian")
isTRUE(gb_result)
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Soutput}
[1] TRUE
\end{Soutput}
\end{Schunk}

The resulting video can be seen at \url{https://youtu.be/fSS0JSb4VxM}.

The output video format is MP4 by default, but several formats can be
specified via specifying the appropriate ``muxer'' for \texttt{ffmpeg}
(see the function \texttt{ffmpeg\_muxers}). Supported codecs can be
founded using the functions \texttt{ffmpeg\_audio\_codecs} and
\texttt{ffmpeg\_video\_codecs}.

We now discuss the number of image and script inputs that \pkg{ari} is
designed to work with, including text files and a series of PNG images,
a Google Slide deck or a PowerPoint presentation with the script written
in the speaker notes section, or an HTML slide presentation created from
an R Markdown, where the script is written in the HTML comments.

\hypertarget{creating-videos-from-r-markdown-documents}{%
\subsubsection{Creating Videos from R Markdown
Documents}\label{creating-videos-from-r-markdown-documents}}

Many R users have experience creating slide decks with R Markdown, for
example using the \CRANpkg{rmarkdown} or \CRANpkg{xaringan} packages
(Allaire et al. 2019; Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund 2018; Xie 2018). In
\pkg{ari}, the HTML slides are rendered using \CRANpkg{webshot} (Chang
2018) and the script is located in HTML comments (i.e.~between
\texttt{\textless{}!-\/-} and \texttt{-\/-\textgreater{}}). For example,
in the file \texttt{ari\_comments.Rmd}, which is an \texttt{ioslides}
type of R Markdown slide deck, we have the last slide:

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
x = readLines(ari_example("ari_comments.Rmd"))
tail(x[ x != ""], 4)
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
[1] "## Conclusion"                                             
[2] "<!--"                                                      
[3] "Thank you for watching this video and good luck using Ari!"
[4] "-->"                                                       
\end{Soutput}
\end{Schunk}

so that the script for this slide starts with \texttt{"Thank\ you"}.
This setup allows for one plain text, version-controllable, integrated
document that can reproducibly generate a video. We believe these
features allow creators to make agile videos, that can easily be updated
with new material or changed when errors or typos are found.

Users can pass in both the R Markdown document and the rendered slides
from the document, or simply the document, and the output will be
created using \texttt{render} from \pkg{rmarkdown} (Allaire et al.
2019). Here we create the video for \texttt{ari\_comments.Rmd}:

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
# Create a video from an R Markdown file with comments and slides
res = ari_narrate(
  script = ari_example("ari_comments.Rmd"),
  voice = "Kendra",
  capture_method = "iterative")
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}

The output video is located at \url{https://youtu.be/rv9fg_qsqc0}. In
our experience with several users we have found that some HTML slides
take more or less time to render when using \pkg{webshot}; for example
they may be tinted with gray because they are in the middle of a slide
transition when the image of the slide is captured. Therefore we provide
the \texttt{delay} argument in \texttt{ari\_narrate} which is passed to
\pkg{webshot}. This can resolve these issues by allowing more time for
the page to fully render, however this means it may take for more time
to create each video. We also provide the argument
\texttt{capture\_method} to allow for finely-tuned control of
\texttt{webshot}. When \texttt{capture\_method\ =\ "vectorized"},
\pkg{webshot} is run on the entire slide deck in a faster process,
however we have experienced slide rendering issues with this setting
depending on the configuration of an individual's computer. However when
\texttt{capture\_method\ =\ "iterative"}, each slide is rendered
individually in \texttt{webshot}, which solves many rendering issues,
however it causes videos to be rendered more slowly.

With respect to accessibility, \pkg{ari} encourages video creators to
type out a script by design. This provides an effortless source of
subtitles for people with hearing loss rather than relying on other
services, such as YouTube, to provide speech-to-text subtitles. When
using \texttt{ari\_spin}, if the \texttt{subtitles} argument is
\texttt{TRUE}, then an SRT file for subtitles will be created with the
video.

One issue with synthesis of technical information is that changes to the
script are required for Amazon Polly or other services to provide a
correct pronunciation. For example, if you want the service to say
``RStudio'' or ``ggplot2'', the phrases ``R Studio'' or ``g g plot 2''
must be written exactly that way in the script. These phrases will then
appear in an SRT subtitle file, which may be confusing to a viewer.

\hypertarget{creating-videos-from-other-documents}{%
\subsubsection{Creating Videos from Other
Documents}\label{creating-videos-from-other-documents}}

In order to create a video from a Google Slide deck or PowerPoint
presentation, the slides should be converted to a set of images. We
recommend using the PNG format for these images. In order to get the
script for the video, we suggest putting the script for each slide in
the speaker notes section of that slide. Several of the following
features for video generation are in our package \pkg{didactr}
(\url{https://github.com/muschellij2/didactr}). The speaker notes of
slides can be extracted using \CRANpkg{rgoogleslides} (Noorazman 2018)
for Google Slides via the API or using
\CRANpkg{readOffice}/\CRANpkg{officer} (Gohel 2019; Ewing 2017) to read
from PowerPoint documents. Google Slides can be downloaded as a PDF and
converted to PNGs using the \CRANpkg{pdftools} package (Ooms 2019). The
\pkg{didactr} package also has a \texttt{pptx\_notes} function for
reading PowerPoint notes. Converting PowerPoint files to PDF can be done
using LibreOffice and the \CRANpkg{docxtractr}(Rudis and Muir 2019)
package which contains the necessary wrapper functions.

To demonstrate this, we use an example PowerPoint is located on Figshare
(\url{https://figshare.com/articles/Example_PowerPoint_for_ari/8865230}).\\
We can convert the PowerPoint to PDF, then to a set of PNG images, then
extract the speaker notes.

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
pptx = "ari.pptx"
pdf = docxtractr::convert_to_pdf(pptx)
pngs = pdftools::pdf_convert(pdf, dpi = 300)
notes = didactr::pptx_notes(pptx)
notes
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Soutput}
[1] "Sometimes it’s hard for an instructor to take the time to record their lectures.
For example, I’m in a coffee shop and it may be loud."

[2] "Here is an example of a plot with really small axes.  We plot the x versus the y
-variables and a smoother between them."
\end{Soutput}
\end{Schunk}

We can then render the video with the ``Kimberly'' voice. We use the
\texttt{divisible\_height} argument to forcibly scale the height of the
images to be divisible by 2 if necessary. This is required by
the\texttt{x264} codec which we have specified as a preset:

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
pptx_result = ari_spin(pngs, notes, output = "pptx.mp4", voice = "Kimberly",
    divisible_height = TRUE, subtitles = TRUE)
isTRUE(pptx_result)
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}

You can see the output at \url{https://youtu.be/TBb3Am6xsQw}. Here we
can see the first few lines of the subtitle file:

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Soutput}
[1] "1"                                       
[2] "00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,025"           
[3] "Sometimes it’s hard for an instructor to"
[4] "2"                                       
[5] "00:00:02,025 --> 00:00:04,005"           
[6] "take the time to record their lectures." 
\end{Soutput}
\end{Schunk}

For Google Slides, the slide deck can be downloaded as a PowerPoint and
the previous steps can be used, however it can also be downloaded
directly as a PDF. The \pkg{didactr} package has the function
\texttt{gs\_notes\_from\_slide} to extract the notes for synthesis. As
this extraction process requires authentication, we will omit it here.
Thus, we should be able to create videos using R Markdown, Google
Slides, or PowerPoint presentations in an automatic fashion.

\hypertarget{summary}{%
\subsection{Summary}\label{summary}}

The \pkg{ari} package combines multiple open-source tools and APIs to
create reproducible workflows for creating videos. These videos can be
created using R Markdown documents, PowerPoint presentations, Google
Slide decks, or simply series of images. The audio overlaid on the
images can be separate or contained within the storage of the images.\\
These workflows can then be reproduced in the future and easily
updated.\\
As the current voice synthesis options are somewhat limited in the
tenacity and inflection given, we believe that educational and
informational videos are the most applicable area.

\hypertarget{future-directions}{%
\subsection{Future directions}\label{future-directions}}

\pkg{ari} and \pkg{didactr} are already being used to build data science
curriculla (Kross and Guo 2019) and we look forward to collaborating
with video creators to augment \pkg{ari} according to their changing
needs. In the following section we outline possible directions for the
future of the project.

Since \pkg{ari} is designed for teaching technical content, we plan to
provide better support for the pronunciation of technical terms like the
names of popular software tools. These names are usually not pronunced
correctly by text-to-speech services because they are not words
contained in the training data used in the deep learning models used by
these services. To address this concern we plan to compile a dictionary
of commonly used technical terms and the phonetic phrasing and spelling
of these terms that are required in order to achieve the correct
pronounciation from text-to-speech services.

In addition to still images and synthesized voices, we would like to
develop new technologies for incorperating other automatically generated
videos into lectures generated by \pkg{ari}. As computer programming,
statistics, and data science instructors we often rely on live coding
(Chen and Guo 2019) to demonstrate software tools to our students. Live
coding videos suffer from many of the same problems as other kinds of
technical videos as we addressed in the introduction. Therefore we plan
to build a system for automating the creation of live coding videos.
These videos would also be created using plain text documents like R
Markdown. They would integrate synthesized narration with code chunks
that would be displayed and executed according to specilized commands
that would specify when code should be executed in an IDE like RStudio.
These commands could also control which panes and tabs of the IDE are
visible or emphasized.

As programmatic video creation software improves, we plan to extend
\pkg{ari} so it can expand its compatibility with different
technologies. For example we believe the heavy reliance on an
\texttt{ffmpeg} installation can be mitigated in the future with
advances in the \pkg{av} package.\\
Though the \pkg{av} package has powerful functionality and is currently
porting more from \texttt{libav} and therefore \texttt{ffmpeg}, it
currently does not have the capabilities required for \pkg{ari}.
Although third party installation from \url{https://ffmpeg.org/} can be
burdensome to a user, package managers such as \texttt{brew} for OSX and
\texttt{choco} for Windows provide an easier installation and
configuration experience.

Although we rely on Amazon Polly for voice synthesis, other packages
provide voice synthesis, such as \CRANpkg{mscstts} for Microsoft and
\CRANpkg{googleLanguageR} for Google. We created the \pkg{text2speech}
package to harmonize these synthesis options for \pkg{ari}.

We see significant potential in how \pkg{ari} could expand global
learning opportunities. Video narration scripts can be automatically
translated into other languages with services like the
\href{https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/}{Google Translation API},
where \pkg{googleLanguageR} provides an interface. Amazon Polly can
speak languages other than English, meaning that one can write a lecture
once and generate lecture videos in multiple languages. Therefore this
workflow can greatly expand the potential audience for educational
videos with relatively little additional effort from lecture creators.
We plan to flesh out these workflows so that video creators can manage
videos in multiple languages. We hope to add functionality so that
communities of learners with language expertise can easily suggest
modifications to automatically translated videos, and tooling so
suggestions can be incorperated quickly.

The workflow we have specified requires many interlocking pieces of
software, therefore we have created a Docker environment
(\url{https://github.com/seankross/bologna}) which contains the required
packages to create videos using \pkg{ari}. This Docker image ensures
that our workflow is completely reproducable, and it also enables
deployment to multiple disk images for creating lecture videos at scale.

\hypertarget{conclusions}{%
\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}}

The \pkg{ari} package combines multiple open-source tools and APIs to
create reproducible workflows for creating educational lecture videos.
These videos can be created using R Markdown documents, PowerPoint
presentations, Google Slide decks, or simply a series of images. The
source of the audio overlaid on the images can be stored in a separate
file or it can be contained within any of the specified file formats.
Our workflow ensures thats these videos can then be reproduced in the
future and easily updated. Given the content that it is practical to
create with this workflow, and the limtted nature of voice synthesis
tools, we believe that \pkg{ari} is most appropriate for the production
of educational and informational videos.
